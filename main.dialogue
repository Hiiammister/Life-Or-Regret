Traveller: Hey there! !

NPC: (Looks up and notices the traveller from afar) Oh, hello! Is that you over there?

Traveller: Yeah, it's me. I need to ask you something.

NPC: Sure, what's on your mind?

Traveller: I've heard rumors about a hidden treasure in the old ruins. Have you heard anything about it?

NPC: (Scratches head) Hmm, a treasure, you say? Well, I've heard whispers, but nothing concrete. Some folks say it's guarded by ancient spirits.

Traveller: Ancient spirits? Sounds intriguing. Any advice on how to get there?

NPC: (Points in the distance) Head west through the dense forest, then follow the river until you reach the ancient bridge. Be careful, though. The path is treacherous.

Traveller: Got it, west through the forest, follow the river, and watch out for the ancient bridge. Thanks for the info!

NPC: No problem! If you find that treasure, maybe throw a coin my way, eh? Good luck!
